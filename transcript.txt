Kind of like when you fuck two girls and they find out and they become best friends, like, it's going to annoy you. And they start going out together all the time and you just don't fuck either of them anymore. And you just ignore both of them and just get a new girl and they like, take selfies together and they're putting it up. It's really going to bother it. You just don't care.
Women don't understand how the world works.
