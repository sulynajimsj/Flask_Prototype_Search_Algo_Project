Have you done? Leg day. And suddenly here's how to survive even most brutal leg day. Hydrate yourself with the tears of your haters. Or be boring and drink some water.
Being dehydrated can reduce strength from five to 10%. Have enough fuel in your tank to get through your workout. Eating enough food throughout the day. Do some light stretching after your workout. You will get rid of some of that tightness.
Unless, of course, you like it tight.
