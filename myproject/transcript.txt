People think you have to be mean to girls. I'm never mean to girls. I'm nice. I'm nice to my girls. People have this idea that I'm walking around the house, beating them up and shit.
Complete opposite. I'm a super nice guy. I'm like, let's watch a movie or get some talk gore and look at the party. I'm a super nice dude. I just don't tolerate disrespect on any level.
Disrespect me. I stopped talking. Talking.
