okay you guys i have been ordering a
bunch of amazon activewear and now i
have this whole box full
it's all super affordable and four stars
and above
i feel like amazon though is a little
bit of a hit or miss sometimes
so see what i'm gonna return what i'm
going to keep i haven't tried on any of
the
items yet so you guys are going to see
my full first reaction i'm going to link
everything down below so if you like
something
and you want to shop you can click the
link down below in the description and
make sure you guys subscribe and let's
get into this video because i'm so
excited it's gonna be so much fun before
we get into the try on
look at how cute topper is being
i'm dying hi buddy first up so many of
these items came
in really nice little zipper bags but
this is the cheapest option like for how
much you get the pack of
three tank tops and it comes in several
different color options i really like to
this one
wheat there's four okay never mind
there's four
tank tops for 26. once a pack of white
i love this green color a dark gray and
black so really good
basics you could wear these to the gym
or probably also
dress them up and wear them with jean
shorts or something so
these are kind of like a two in one
these are so cute material doesn't feel
super sweat wicking 95 cotton but it
does have
a little bit of spandex in it so not the
like most
ideal fabric for working out but for
the price where you get all four of
these so cute okay so i'm gonna go and
try these on first kind of thought when
i put this one on
is that it runs a little bit tight like
it doesn't really bother me because i do
like it to kind of like hug my body more
for something that i'm wearing at the
gym but if you're not a fan of that and
you want it to be a little bit looser
you could definitely size up i feel like
with a lot of these like cheaper brands
i really want to size up a little bit
this is super cute i love this color
i was honestly so so surprised by this
i'll show you guys what it looks like in
the back
just a plain razorback if you just want
like a cute crop top to throw on to
style it with
a pair of jean shorts and then you dress
it up with some jewelry and accessories
or
layer it these are good layering tank
tops i
am actually kind of shocked super super
cute so
we're off to a good start up next has an
actual built-in bra
in it so it's very similar it's just a
crop tank with a razorback but
this one has a built-in bra with the
fabric on this one
feels really nice it's definitely more
of a spandex and like
nylon i think so this one is nylon and
spandex a better
workout material a little bit more sweat
wicking this one
feels a lot more expensive than just
twenty dollars and i got this adorable
pink color this one also comes in lots
of colors this brand recommended sizing
up
so normally i wear around a size medium
so i sized up to a large
and we're gonna see how this one fits
okay this color is so
pretty i feel like i could have done a
medium this top
in a large would be really good for just
kind of hanging out
it's really good lounging size because
it's
super comfortable super soft i love the
fabric
it like doesn't cut in anywhere would i
be able to go for a run in
probably not just because i don't feel
like i have enough compression
it still hugs very well like it's not
loose anywhere
but here's the back super cute
but i really like this pink i'm glad i
branched out this one
super excited about a whole set for
thirty dollars
it's this little rib set so you get the
sports bra and it's just like a plain
back nothing too fancy or crazy but it
has the built-in pads
just pulled this out of the package i
was honestly surprised
by the material i was afraid that it
would probably be a little bit
see-through
but honestly it feels like it's not
really going to be see-through
at all it feels like really good quality
super thick these are the little biker
shorts that it comes with
guys know that normally i like to wear
black and i go for a lot of black my
last lululemon haul
i had like basically everything was
black so for this one i decided to try
and kind of branch out and get some
different colors that i normally don't
get so
i got this kind of like burnt orangish
red color super pretty and let's see how
this one fits
um such a fun color don't know if i
would do
like a full workout in this it's more of
like a cute
lounge set um the shorts i feel like
though
aren't gonna ride up so that's really
good that's definitely a plus
i would say that it's like slightly
squat proof like if you got
any color that's lighter than this you
would probably definitely be able to see
through
like i know they have like a light blue
i'm pretty sure and that would probably
be so see-through
this one is like a teeny tiny bit like i
would maybe do arm days black would
probably be
pretty good as far as that don't know if
i'm gonna keep this though because i
honestly don't know how often i would
wear it up next this
is super lightweight workout tank with
an open back
and then right here there's a slit where
you
tie it up or you can just leave it loose
if you want a looser fit you can see
that it's like kind of like
meshy material it's not super heavy
weight this color is kind of like an
olive green and at first when i pulled
it out i wasn't
so sure about it almost like a pukey
color but
i feel like it'll actually look really
good here we have it on this is what it
looks like
without it being tied i'll turn around
so you guys can see this fabric is the
type of fabric that just like
clings to my skin which i'm not a huge
fan
of here's what it looks like tied up oh
this looks so much better
okay not bad okay so here's
here's the back okay this is super cute
with a strappy
sports bra would i keep this one i'm not
entirely sure because
the fabric honestly kind of bugs me the
way that it like
clings to my skin okay this one i am so
excited about i
got this one in last night this is such
a good lululemon dupe definitely looks
like a dupe
for the eptistry crop tank looks exactly
the same
same ribbed detail this one in a size
eight it even has a tag just like blue
lemon
feels really comfy supportive and soft
so i'm so pumped about this one
i'm kind of sad about this one this is
the one i was the most excited for
this is not the best quality
i don't even really know if sizing down
would help me out because this is just
so weird right here like it's
kind of gaping right here you can tell
that the material
or i guess you could say like the fit is
not the best
and i'm curious if sizing down i got a
size 8
which is kind of around my normal size
at 11. i was a little bit nervous
because that was
the biggest size that they sold in this
top they also sell this in a long length
one
um and i'm curious to see if a size 6
would work better because it's supposed
to fit
like pretty skin tight like the other
crop tops that i tried on
um but yeah the fit up here is just not
good there's like no support
i don't really know if like the pads
like in the built-in bra
are good quality at all i'm so sad about
this one
last one i actually didn't just order
this one i've had this one for a while
i've been wearing it and i really like
this one
this is energy long line sports bra dupe
which i love
that sports bra from lululemon i would
say the biggest difference between
this one and the one from blue lemon is
the fabric this one's more cottony and
the one from lululemon is a lot more
sweat wicking than that
but that's the biggest difference for me
one thing i would say about this sports
bra
one is a size medium or something like
that and i wish i would have sized up to
a large
just because it runs really small it's
kind of tight
um compared to my lululemon one but i
want like something that
has a little bit more compression then
get your normal size but if you
don't want to be like squished then go
up a size it has
the exact same strappy back on it and i
love
this kind of like olive green color so
i'll show you guys what this one looks
like onto
okay here's how this one fits it's a
little bit snug
like i said but has a lot of compression
so i'll show you guys the back
so what it looks like and
i love this olive green color i love the
way the straps are super flattering
for now i have one more thing coming
it's a pair of running shorts
but i think i'm gonna head out to the
pool now because it is such a nice day
and we've been kind of having like bad
weather lately so i'll see you all
whenever i get to try on those shorts so
we just got back from the pool
and i got my last amazon find in these
are the crz yoga
running shorts and these feel really
nice they are definitely kind of like a
little dupe
for the hottie hot shorts at lululemon
they have
a little drawstring in the front super
nice
waistband i think these are mid-rise
um and then they have a little pocket on
the back and kind of like
this little mesh on the side and then
also a built-in underwear and they come
in several colors this is kind of like a
little burgundy color
kind of too tight for me i feel like
they would fit perfectly
if i went up a size i kind of was like
going back and forth between
getting a size up just by the reviews
ignore it with this pink tank top this
does not go at all these
i feel like would be perfect if i
actually had
the right size they're so cute and i
actually really like this color
but i'm so disappointed i like my shorts
to be like a little bit looser but i
feel like
overall these are like really good now i
just need them to fit
and i guess that wraps up the rest of
this video i hope you guys enjoyed and
found something that you might want to
order next time you're on amazon
or possibly not if there was something
that you
didn't think it would turn out the way
you thought it did like
my lululemon dupe i'm so sad about that
still look in the description below for
all the links again

fun making this one
