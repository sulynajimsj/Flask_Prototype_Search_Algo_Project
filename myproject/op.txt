hello everyone this is a relatively new
product as far as i can tell
i keep up with hybrid guitars when i can
i've owned
probably close to a dozen different
hybrid guitars throughout the time i
played guitar
in fact the first guitar that i ever
one of the first guitars that i ever
owned
the first
electric guitar that i had
was a charvel charbette which
uh that
doesn't sound like an acoustic guitar um
but it was
in the shape of a telecaster
um and kind of similar to this but
binding on both sides
if you look up the cramer farrington
that's f e r r i n g t o n
you'll get exactly
the same thing but by kramer
mine was a charvel
i guess trying to compete with it
and
it did not have these fancy single coil
pickups here like this michael kelly
does
but it had an acoustic bridge like this
and it actually had a nice equalizer
here on the side i couldn't find a lot
of information on this guitar
uh i looked on the michael kelly website
and there really isn't a whole lot
and i looked online and there is one
video that michael kelly made that's
about a minute
and you can't find it unless you go on
their website
and or take the link it is an unlisted
video
so this is a very new product from what
i can tell and i could not find even a
product manual to tell me what the
different there's five way switches that
we'll try out
uh in a moment here
uh to give you a blend of the single
coil and the
piezo pickup
let's get to
some of the features
and
i will go straight from the features
into what i like about it
and then what i don't like about it and
i'll do a little bit of a tone sampler
so
it has a roasted maple
it says flame maple on the description
um
i would say yeah if you can tell
the
back of the neck here
has
a very roasted maple
neck
so get that real close in there
if you can see it it's got some nice
flames
uh the front of the neck
uh
not as much in the flames it's more just
transparent but it's nice uh
the front ends are not sharp you can
feel them
towards the bottom you can feel fred
ends but
uh they've been filed nice enough that
like you don't really notice the money
played
it's not the cleanest
uh fret leveling but
it's not bad for a 500 guitar which is
the big reason why i was interested in
it because it reminded me quite a bit of
the
current fender acoustic sonics
which have a mexican model
as their cheapest offering at 1200.
this is 500
as i said and these are rock field
pickups they're the proprietary michael
kelly
um
brand
uh there's some nice binding on the
sound holes
and around the top
the top
is
a very nice transparent finish in blue
it's mahogany
and the top is spalted maple
according to the american musical site i
bought this from american musical
i'm not sponsored in any way by michael
kelly though
uh i'm
getting pretty close to 200 subscribers
and i at least some of those subscribers
watch me for these guitar videos so uh
michael kelly if you want to sponsor me
hit me up you know i'll test out some
guitars
i like michael kelly quite a bit
um it is a bolt-on neck of course and
like i said the body is mahogany
and
there is a five-way switch once again
so
let's get into
a bit more here uh oh real quick
here's the tuners
now they're not walking but they're
pretty nice standard tuners that you
would see on a guitar in this price
range
uh the
bridge is an acoustic style bridge like
they have on their higher end hybrid
uh which i've tried those and they're
very nice i think they are definitely
nicer than these
uh which would justify the 900 price tag
as opposed to this being a 500 low price
tag
so
here's
my assertion
if we start up here
with the five-way switch
and i am going through
a i have
a para acoustic by ella lr bags that's
like di box
to help with the acoustic tones i think
it really helps with the acoustic tones
i have a joyo american for my electric
guitar tones uh and then i have a couple
effects pedals one by donor one by joyo
the donor is a
delay the joyo is a chorus
the
reverb that you will hear is coming from
my fender passport which i plug into and
it's not a whole lot of reverb but i
like reverb if you want this
straight up with no effects
i don't know let me know and i'll make
one
that really deep dives into the tones
so if i go from here
that's with the overdrive
[Music]
and my assertion of this one would be
that it's just a neck pickup that's what
i think
[Music]
it's it's nice for like
just playing alone
and you might be in your bedroom or
while you're watching tv i would say
uh this
second position here
i think some people call it several
position i don't know um has the neck
and the piezo from what i understand
so
i'll
turn off the joyo because that's
definitely giving me some overdrive and
this is just to the para acoustic
[Music]
but
the
tone knob seems to be for the single
coils it's a universal tone knob
uh it's a universal volume there are no
separate controls for the acoustic i was
really hoping that there would be um
maybe i should have
looked a little uh
more into the description
you know it is what it is uh it was hard
to tell like i said there isn't a whole
lot of extra information this is a very
new product and they could have waited a
little longer
if you go to the middle position
that seems to be
the
two single coil pickups blended together
um and i really get that vibe because
if i go here
[Music]
and then i go to the middle
[Music]
i think it's a
it's a bit more of that wiry tone
of the strap
[Music]
now
[Music]
i feel there's there's a thicker warmer
sound there from
[Music]
okay
and this is more
electric
so if i turn the joyo back on
uh which i have some dry on
i would say these rock field pickups
they aren't too bad uh again i think the
pyramids
hybrid
[Music]
with the humbuckers does a better job
but
for the price i don't know um
i do think i have a couple videos up
that you can check out of me doing some
no simple covers
you don't like the kind of thing i think
they're not too bad
and
so it is nice to go
here's this position this is a louder
position than the top one
and my assertion is that this is the
piezo and the bridge
[Music]
it is kind of nice if i turn on the joyo
and i'll add like chorus
[Music]
kind of get a mix of the two
[Music]
and then if i go to the last position
which i believe is just the bridge
pickup
[Music]
uh here if i turn the volume all the way
down
if you can hear that
again kind of nice for
just messing around
um there's a couple spots where you can
tell it's a 500 guitar the binding is a
little weird here
um it's not painted so well around the
joint
the neck joint
uh
although i'm trying this video is longer
than i wanted it to be but it's hard
when you're explaining everything
so
yeah
um
i think it's it's a nice looking guitar
it plays nice the neck is nice crafted
in vietnam it says
overall i would say
i am mixed
on it um
i think i will keep it around for a
while
if you can spend a little bit more money
i would
venture to say
that
the regular mike kelly hybrid is
probably the best value at around 900
fail
at least at this point i would recommend
michael kelly guitars uh if
if you see this video and you think this
guitar is going to scratch that itch and
you're in like the 500 range it looks
nice it plays nice
again my gripes would more be with i
don't think that the single color
pickups are all that great and i would
really like more control on the acoustic
end
but i don't know
the the struggle with a hybrid acoustic
electric guitar is that they never
are going to replace
uh
one or the other
and i'll try to remember to do an update
on whether or not i keep it
again i have some cover videos
short
ones up uh if you want to see more sound
examples with it
i have a few more reviews
i have some really cool vaporwave mixes
that other people i think have
subscribed for i got more of those
coming up if you're interested
i don't know if my followers are kind of
split down the middle with these sort of
videos but
anyway please like please subscribe um
thank you
